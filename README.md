# Comcast Enterprise GitHub Organization

## Overview
GitHub Enterprise Cloud (GHEC) enables scalable and secure collaboration across development teams. However, creating and managing multiple independent GitHub organizations within an enterprise introduces challenges across administration, security and compliance, and operational efficiency.

To address these challenges, we have established a **centralized GitHub organization — Comcast-Enterprise** — to streamline **team onboarding**, **repository management**, and **access governance**.

---

## Repository Usage Policy
- This organization is intended **exclusively for hosting private repositories**
- **Internal repositories are not supported**
- 📌 Any internal repository created in this organization will be **automatically converted to private** by a daily automation process

---

## Access Management Model
User access and repository permissions are managed **strictly through teams** to ensure proper segregation of duties and minimize unauthorized access.

### Core Teams
The following standard teams will be provisioned for each onboarding request:

- **Admin Team**
  - Full administrative access to associated repositories

- **Write Team**
  - Write (push) access to designated repositories

- **Read Team**
  - Read-only access to designated repositories

Access is granted based on **team membership only**.

---

## Getting Started
To onboard your team or repository into the **Comcast-Enterprise GitHub Organization**:

1. Submit a request through the designated onboarding queue
2. The platform team will provision teams and repositories
3. Access will be granted based on the approved request

Onboarding is handled promptly once the request is submitted.

## Alternative Options
Teams may continue using one of the **existing GitHub organizations** if it better aligns with their operational or ownership requirements.
